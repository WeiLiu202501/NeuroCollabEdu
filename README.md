# NeuroCollabEdu: EEG-Based Evaluation of Interprofessional Collaboration in Health Professions Education

## Overview

**NeuroCollabEdu** introduces an innovative approach to assessing the impact of interprofessional collaboration (IPC) on studentsâ€™ attention in health professions education. Traditional evaluation methods lack precision and objectivity, failing to capture real-time cognitive and behavioral responses. This research integrates **EEG analysis** to bridge this gap, offering a **multimodal, real-time approach** to analyzing attention patterns.

To achieve this, we propose:

- **Integrated Multidisciplinary Health Model (IMHM)**: A multimodal framework that fuses EEG data, graph-based collaboration modeling, and temporal dynamics to analyze interprofessional interactions.
- **Adaptive Knowledge-Driven Health Strategy (AKDHS)**: Utilizes real-time EEG feedback, temporal attention mechanisms, and knowledge-guided feature prioritization to optimize student attention evaluation.

The proposed methodology enables dynamic adaptation of educational strategies, fostering improved collaborative learning outcomes.

## Features

- **EEG-Based Attention Monitoring**: Objective measurement of cognitive engagement during interprofessional activities.
- **Multimodal Data Fusion**: Integrates EEG signals, behavioral metrics, and collaboration patterns.
- **Graph-Based Collaboration Modeling**: Represents team interactions dynamically.
- **Temporal Attention Mechanism**: Captures attention shifts during educational sessions.
- **Real-Time Feedback Integration**: Supports adaptive learning strategies in health education.
